Welcome ! It seems you are intrested in my Melon OS...

** HOW TO BUILD MELON : **
This is supposed to work in a Linux environment. Maybee it could work on *BSD, or Cygwin, but that wasn't tested.

You need :
- GCC
- Nasm
- Qemu or Bochs for testing (Qemu works better, debugging is planned for bochs)

If you haven't yet downloaded the source code, then commit the GIT repository :
$ git clone git://github.com/Alexis211/Melon.git

Then, rebuild everything :
$ make mrproper
$ make

Create the floppy image :
$ make floppy
You will probably be prompted for your password. We need it to mount the floppy image as a loopback device.

And run it with Qemu :
$ make qemu
