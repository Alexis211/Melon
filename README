Welcome ! It seems you are intrested in my Melon OS...

 DISCLAIMER :
============

This software is HIGHLY UNTESTED, and will probably have UNEXPECTED EFFECTS on any hardware you run it on.
I will not be held responsible for any damage caused by this software.


 HOW TO BUILD MELON :
====================

This is supposed to work in a Linux environment. Maybee it could work on *BSD, or Cygwin, but that hasn't been tested.

You need :
- Git for cloning the repository
- GCC
- Nasm
- Qemu or Bochs for testing (Qemu works better, debugging is planned for bochs)

If you haven't yet downloaded the source code, then clone the GIT repository :
$ git clone git://github.com/Alexis211/Melon.git

Then, rebuild everything :
$ make mrproper
$ make

And run it with Qemu :
$ make qemu
	OR
$ make qemu-hdd
You will probably be prompted for your password. We need it to mount the floppy/HDD image as a loopback
device to update its contents.
The second option boots from the HDD instead of the floppy.


 HOW TO CONFIGURE THE GRUB ENTRIES : 
===================================

If you want to change the entries that appear when you `make qemu`, then edit the Grub-menu-fdd.cfg or
Grub-menu-hdd.cfg, then re-run `make qemu` or `make qemu-hdd`.

The options for the kernel command line are the following :
- vesa:[disabled|enabled]	enables or disables the VESA driver (hangs on Bochs when enabled)
- keymap:[builtin|...]		selects a keymap. keymaps are in Source/Kernel/Ressources/Keymaps
							built-in keymap is defined in Source/Kernel/DeviceManager/Kbd.ns.cpp
- init:<init_app>			select the init application to run. empty string = go to kernel shell.
							default is /System/Applications/PaperWork.app

You also can edit those entries when booting by pressing 'e'. That will launch GRUB's editor.
