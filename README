Welcome ! It seems you are intrested in my Melon OS...

** HOW TO BUILD MELON : **
This is supposed to work in a Linux environment. Maybee it could work on *BSD, or Cygwin, but that wasn't tested.

You need :
- GCC
- Nasm
- Qemu or Bochs for testing (Qemu works better, debugging is planned for bochs)

If you haven't yet downloaded the source code, then commit the GIT repository :
$ git clone git://github.com/Alexis211/Melon.git

Then, rebuild everything :
$ make mrproper
$ make

Create the floppy image :
$ make floppy
You will probably be prompted for your password. We need it to mount the floppy image as a loopback device.

And run it with Qemu :
$ make qemu

** HOW TO CONFIGURE THE GRUB ENTRIES : **
If you want to change the entries that appear when you `make qemu`, then edit the Grub-menu.cfg and `make floppy` again.

The options for the kernel command line are the following :
- vesa:[disabled|enabled]	enables or disables the VESA driver (hangs on Bochs when enabled)
- keymap:[builtin|...]		selects a keymap. keymaps are in Source/Kernel/Ressources/Keymaps
							built-in keymap is defined in Source/Kernel/DeviceManager/Kbd.ns.cpp
- init:<init_app>			select the init application to run. empty string = go to kernel shell.
							default is /System/Applications/PaperWork.app
